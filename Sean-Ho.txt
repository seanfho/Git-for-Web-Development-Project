Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Block element: Start on a new line and take up full available width
    Inline element: Do not start on new line and only take up as much space as is necessary to fit them

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    Unlike a "fixed" position element an element with the position: absolute property will be positioned relative to it's nearest ancestor, rather than relative to the viewpoint.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    To do this you can give the element the display: inline-block property.

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    display: block; --> <section> , <h1-h6>, <div>
    display: inline; --> <a> , <img>

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
    The CSS box-model is the standard design/shape/structure/layout of all HTML "boxes"/"containers" . The model, from inside-out, consists of the "content" wrapped by "padding" wrapped by "border" wrapped by "margin".
    The "fix" to ensure elements remain their assigned widths we can give the element a property of box-sizing: border-box; which will affect the way the width and height of an element are calculated. 
    With border-sizing: border-box; width = width
    Without border-sizing: border-box; width = width+padding+border
